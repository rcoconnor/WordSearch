# WordSearch
A program which helps the user solve word search puzzles.  Created in 2017 as project 5 of CS100.  The program works by reading a puzzle from a text file and then displaying the puzzle to the user.  The user may then enter a word and the program will display the location of the word back to the user (left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top) if the word exists and how many times the word exists; if the word does not exist the program will display a blank puzzle

# Instructions
when executing the file, include how many characters long the puzzle is followed by the text file where the puzzle is located

example - ./a.out 14 pizza.txt

the program ends when the user enters zzz
